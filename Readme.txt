Hello, I am Kartikey Tiwari Student of Raj Kumar Goel Institute of Technology.
I upload two files of same python code one with extension .py and another one with .ipynb,
I Suggest you to open it in google collab to run code and most importantly 
please upload input files on google collab to avoid errors in the code, 
I use with open functionality to read input text files so please you can change 
the names of files in code (1 to 2 or 2 to 1) accordingly.

Design:
Starting with function to check is word compound or not and further it looks for lengthiest compound word function, and 
then it uses time module to compute processing time which start with start time and endtime and then it uses with open to 
read the input files and the printing of the solutions.

Overview:
I use two data structures of python which are "set" and "dictionary" and use recursive approach to solve this problem,
sets are used store my words and dictionary used for calculated compound reslulted word

Approach:
code consist of dictionary which is used to store previous calculated result, Main approach is to iterates through word prefixes and recursively checks for valid compound words.
The code sorts words by length for the identification of the longest and second-longest compounds.
 

Apart from this first I check for the problem on the web and few solution regarding this but In those solutions,
they're using various data structure like queue and trie, but I don't know the use of tries So I choose to do with set and dictionary.

Thank you.
