Hello, I am Kartikey Tiwari Student of Raj Kumar Goel Institute of Technology.
I upload two files of same python code one with extension .py and another one with .ipynb,
I Suggest you to open it in google collab to run code and most importantly 
please upload input files on google collab to avoid errors in the code, 
I use with open functionality to read input text files so please you can change 
the names of files in code (1 to 2 or 2 to 1) accordingly.


Apart from this first I check for the problem on the web and few solution regarding this but In those solutions,
they're using various data structure like queue and trie, but I don't know the use of tries So I choose to do with set and dictionary.

Thank you.
